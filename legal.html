                  <h4>4.1 - Eligibility to Register a User Account</h4>

                  </ol> 
                  <p>An Intending User who does not satisfy all of the foregoing criteria is not eligible to register an account with {{brand_domain}} or to become a User. <strong>{{brand_acronym}}, in its sole discretion, may require additional information or documentation from an Intending User or User prior to completing the registration of a User Account or at any time thereafter, including for the purposes of confirming a User's identity or other User Contact Information and in order to investigate any other suspected breaches of this Agreement (including any suspected fraudulent or dishonest activity). A failure of the Intending User to satisfy any of the foregoing will constitute a material breach of this Agreement.</strong></p>
                  <p>Renewed access to and use of a User Account for an Intending User with either a Closed Account, Suspended Account or Deactivated Account may only be requested in accordance with the processes set out in Sections 11.1, 12.1 and 12.2, respectively, and is subject to {{brand_acronym}} approval in its sole and absolute discretion.</p>
                  <p>In the case of registration of a Standard User Account, {{brand_acronym}} will disclose the registration information of an Intending User or User, as applicable, and additional information or documentation provided for the purposes of authenticating the registration information to third-party service providers for such purposes and to otherwise confirm that an Intending User or User, as applicable, has satisfied the foregoing criteria and is eligible to register or transition to a Standard User Account. In addition, {{brand_acronym}} may similarly disclose information in respect of a User to third-parties from time to time for the purposes of</p>
                  <ol class="lower-roman">
                    <li>confirming the User's continued eligibility to maintain a User Account,</li>
                    <li>investigating any suspected breaches of this Agreement (including any suspected fraudulent or dishonest activity), and</li>
                    <li>exercising any of {{brand_acronym}}'s other rights described in this Agreement or in any of the other documents incorporated in this Agreement by reference pursuant to Section 3.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>By providing any information or documentation to {{brand_acronym}}, the Intending User (or the User, as the case may be) consents to the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of such information by {{brand_acronym}} for any and all of the purposes contemplated in this Agreement or in any of the other documents incorporated in this Agreement by reference pursuant to Section 3.  Please see the {{brand_acronym}} Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy for additional information regarding the collection, use, disclosure and storage of personal information by {{brand_acronym}}.</p>
                  <h4>4.2 - User Account Information</h4>
                  <p>Information that is submitted by an Intending User who is registering an account with {{brand_domain}} must be true, accurate and complete at the time it is provided to {{brand_acronym}} and such information must remain true, accurate and complete following the registration of a User Account.  If any of such registration information changes following the registration of a User Account, it is the User's sole responsibility to ensure that the User remains entitled to have a User Account pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and, if necessary, to update the User's information in the User Account within the application and/or relevant third-party application.</p>
                  <p>{{brand_acronym}} may, from time to time, disclose a User's registration information to third-party service providers for the purposes of confirming that the User's registration information remains true and accurate.  In addition, {{brand_acronym}} may, at any time in its sole discretion, request additional information and documentation from a User and may disclose such additional information and documentation to third parties for this purpose.</p>
                  <p>You consent that {{brand_acronym}}, and its third-party service providers, can collect, use, store and disclose personal information as defined in the {{brand_acronym}} Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy. You consent that this information can be used, stored, retained, and disclosed in whatever region {{brand_acronym}} deems necessary. This consent enables the following services to be provided:</p>
                  <ol class="lower-roman">
                    <li>verification of identity;</li>
                    <li>payment processing;</li>
                    <li>location verification;</li>

                    <li>customer relationship management and User support;</li>
                    <li>email services; and</li>
                    <li>technical support.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>The failure of a User to update their User Account information in a timely manner will constitute a material breach of this Agreement by the User.  Following the registration of a User Account, if {{brand_acronym}} discovers that any of the registration information associated with a User Account which is then on file is not true or is no longer accurate or complete (including, for example, because a User's circumstances have changed and the User did not update their information that is associated with the User Account), {{brand_acronym}} may take all steps in relation to the User or the User Account that {{brand_acronym}} determines, in its sole discretion, to be appropriate.  For example, these steps may include Suspending, or Deactivating the User Account, investigating any security issues and, in the case of suspected or actual identity theft or fraud, disclosing all relevant information to the appropriate law enforcement authorities and other third parties that {{brand_acronym}} determines to be appropriate (for example, {{brand_acronym}}'s payment processors).</p>

                  <p>{{brand_acronym}} may require a User to provide additional information and documentation if {{brand_acronym}}, in its sole discretion, determines that the additional information or documentation is needed to comply with applicable laws or regulatory requirements, or if {{brand_acronym}} considers the collection of such information or documentation to be necessary or advisable in order to prevent fraud or other illegal activity (whether suspected or actual) or to otherwise address a suspected or actual breach of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or to confirm a User's identity or entitlement to receive or withdraw Unutilized Funds.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a User will be required to provide to {{brand_acronym}} such information and documentation as {{brand_acronym}} may determine that it requires in order to comply with any and all regulatory reporting obligations.  By providing such additional information or documentation to {{brand_acronym}}, the User will be deemed to represent and warrant to {{brand_acronym}} that such information is true and accurate or that such documentation is a true, accurate and complete copy of the original.</p>
                  <h4>4.4 - Accessing a User account</h4>
                  <p>When registering for a User Account, an Intending User will be required to create Login Credentials.  Following the registration of a User Account, the User is solely responsible for maintaining the security and secrecy of the User's Login Credentials, including related security or verification questions and answers.  A User is not permitted to disclose the Login Credentials to any other individual (including, without limitation, other Users, Prospective Users, family members, or minors), and only the User is permitted to use the Login Credentials to log into the relevant User Account.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a User is not permitted to use their Login Credentials or Device Biometric Authentication for the purpose of giving any other individual access to the User's Account for any reason.  All transactions (for example, changes to registration information and User Contact Information, deposits, withdrawals, purchases) made through a User Account following the correct entry or application of valid Login Credentials (including while Device Biometric Authentication is enabled) will be deemed to have been made by the User, and the User will be solely responsible for all such transactions.</p>
                  <p>If a User intentionally or unintentionally discloses their Login Credentials to anyone else, or if the User suspects that someone else might have discovered the User's Login Credentials (whether or not such other person has used or attempted to use the User's Login Credentials), the User must immediately change their password on {{brand_domain}} amd any applicable third-party applications, and notify User Support regarding the compromise or possible compromise of the original Login Credentials.</p>
                  <p>A User can change the password associated with their Login Credentials at any time by going to the “My Account” or “Account Information” page.</p>
                  <p>A User may have the option to enable (through their User Account) Device Biometric Authentication to access their User Account.</p>
                  <p>The User is responsible for the care and control of any device they use to access {{brand_domain}}, store Device Biometric Data or enable Device Biometric Authentication. The User acknowledges that once Device Biometric Authentication is enabled through their User Account, any Biometric Data stored in the device used to enable the feature can be used to access the User’s Account. Each time a User uses Device Biometric Authentication to access their User Account, they will be deemed to represent and warrant to {{brand_acronym}} that their own and no other individual’s Device Biometric Data has been used as part of Device Biometric Authentication. {{brand_acronym}} does not access nor store Device Biometric Data.</p>
                  <p>{{brand_acronym}} shall not be liable for any direct or indirect damages arising out of or related to the User’s use of, inability to use, or enabling of Device Biometric Authentication. {{brand_acronym}} reserves the right to disable Device Biometric Authentication at any time without notice.</p>
                  <p>A User may have the option of enabling Multi-Factor Authentication as an additional verification factor to access their User Account along with the use of a User’s Login Credentials. <strong>“Multi-Factor Authentication”</strong> is an authentication method that requires the User to input a Time-based One-time Password provided by that third-party application in addition to their Login Credentials, to confirm the User’s identity when they attempt to sign-in to their User Account. A “Time-based One-time Password” is a temporary password generated by a third-party application that can only be used once and within a certain period of time before it becomes invalid, at which point the User will be required to input a newly generated Time-based One-time Password.</p>
                  <p>A User may download any third-party authenticator application to their mobile device or desktop from Google Play or Apple’s App store, including but not limited to Google Authenticator, Duo Mobile or Microsoft Authenticator. By choosing to download, access or use a third-party application, the User accepts and agrees that there may be additional terms and conditions governing this application and it is the User’s responsibility to determine whether to accept and agree to such third-party terms and conditions. {{brand_acronym}} shall not be liable for any direct or indirect damages resulting from the download, access or use of the third-party application selected by the User in accordance with Section 14.1 and 14.2 of this Agreement.</p>
                  <h4>4.5 - User Accounts</h4>
                  <p>A User can access the details of their User Account through the {{brand_domain}} website by going to the “My Account” or “Account Information” page including, for example, to see the following information:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>the User's registration information, including User Contact Information;</li>
                    <li>the User's Login Credentials, as well as related security questions and answers;</li>
                    <li>the current notional balance of the Standard User Account;</li>
                    <li>the financial transaction history associated with the User Account; and</li>
                    <li>the usage and participation history associated with the User Account.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>If a User discovers any inaccuracy or error in the information that is contained in their User Account, or if the User suspects that such an inaccuracy or error may exist, regardless of who is responsible for the inaccuracy or error, the User is required to immediately contact User Support.</p>
                  <p>{{brand_domain}} is a website and application meant for personal entertainment.  A User may only use their User Account for these purposes.  A User may only use their User Account for personal or professional purposes.  A User is not permitted to use {{brand_domain}} or any component thereof (including a User Account) or any content included on {{brand_domain}} for any business, commercial or public purpose or for any other purpose that {{brand_acronym}} advises the User from time to time is not permitted.  Without limiting the generality if the foregoing, a User may not, through chat or otherwise, display, provide or transmit any content that is deemed by {{brand_acronym}} to be inappropriate (including by use of a username or nickname) or threaten, bully or otherwise harass any other User.</p>
                  <p>{{brand_acronym}} may take all steps in relation to the User or the User Account that {{brand_acronym}} determines, in its sole discretion, to be appropriate in respect of any hateful, discriminatory, sexist, violent, offensive or other inappropriate content. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, {{brand_acronym}} may, in its sole discretion, require that a username or nickname be changed, remove any content deemed to {{brand_acronym}} to be non-compliant with the foregoing and/or Suspend or Deactivate the User Account.</p>
                  <p>A User Account is not the property of the User and cannot be assigned or transferred to or shared with any other person by the User for any purpose.</p>
                  <p>To be eligible to access certain premium features (subject to availability) through their User Account, a User must, at the first instance and for the duration of their access, meet requirements as deemed necessary by {{brand_acronym}}, including but not limited to:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>The Total Balance of their User Account must be greater than zero (for certainty, the balance of at least one of the Cash Balance or the Bonus Funds balance must be greater than zero);</li>
                    <li>The User has participated with the application within a specified period prior to first accessing the premium feature; and/or</li>
                    <li>The premium feature(s) is in respect of a specific event on which the User has eligibility.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>For certainty, a User will lose any access they have to premium features upon failing to meet the foregoing eligibility requirements, and any other necessary conditions.</p>
                  <h3>5 | Future Participation</h3>
                  <h4>5.1 - Payment Options</h4>
                  <p>Users may engage in certain features by way of any regular or alternative method provided, in so much that a User has Unutilized Funds (or, subject to the relevant Bonus Fund Terms, Bonus Funds) in their User Account, or by Direct Pay (subject to system availability) in accordance with the Direct Pay Subscription Terms, and otherwise complies with the terms of this Section 5 and the {{brand_acronym}}<em> Rules</em>.</p>
                  <h4>5.2 - Participation Options:</h4>
                  <p>{{brand_acronym}} may offer Users varied types of usage and participation options, and implement or remove them at their sole discretion.</p>
                  <h4>5.3 - Future Transactions</h4>
                  <p>Any post-dated transaction implemented by and/or agreed to by a User, by way of a transfer of monetary value in accordance with this Section 5.3, is referred to as a “<strong>Future Transaction</strong>”.</p>
                  <p>A User who engages in, or attempts to engage in, Future Transactions is solely responsible for continually ensuring that:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>their User Account contains sufficient Unutilized Funds (or Bonus Funds, if applicable) or that their permitted Direct Pay payment method is valid, operational and authorized by the issuing entity to process transactions (“<strong>Funded</strong>”), as applicable, for such Future Transaction; and</li>
                    <li>that the User has completed the Future Transactions with adequate time (as determined by {{brand_acronym}}) to allow {{brand_acronym}} to process and record such transaction.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such User must, in addition to complying with all of the other terms and conditions of this Agreement which are then in effect:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>ensure that they have a valid eligibility and authorization for the applicable feature as evidenced by the transaction confirmation displayed within their User Account; and</li>
                    <li>ensure the existence, completeness, and accuracy of the information displayed within their User Account (including, without limitation all purchase confirmations);</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>all before such feature commences.</p>
                  <p>{{brand_acronym}} does not undertake any obligation or responsibility for notifying a User:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>if they do not have valid eligibility and authorization (as such term is defined in the <em>{{brand_acronym}} Rules</em>) for any particular feature and/or event; or</li>
                    <li>if they do or may have insufficient Unutilized Funds (or Bonus Funds, if applicable) available or if their permitted Direct Pay payment method is not Funded, to participate in a particular feature or event, prior to rejecting the relevant transaction,</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>provided that the foregoing will not restrict {{brand_acronym}}'s ability to so notify a User.</p>
                  <h3>6 | Deposits &amp; Direct Pay</h3>
                  <h4>6.1 - Funding Accounts &amp; Direct Pay</h4>
                  <p>In order to participate on {{brand_domain}}, a User is required to have a positive notional balance of funds in their Standard User Account or via their payment method. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a User may participate through their User Account, using Direct Pay on {{brand_domain}} (subject to system availability). Direct Pay is a feature available only to Users with a User Account. <strong>{{brand_acronym}} will not extend credit to Users.</strong></p>
                  <p>If, at the time that the relevant application features are engaged, a User Account does not have sufficient funds available or a permitted Direct Pay payment method is not Funded, then the participation will not register as successfully completed, and the User’s attempts will be rejected.  A User is solely responsible for ensuring that their User Account contains sufficient funds or their permitted Direct Pay payment method is Funded, as applicable, for any transactional feature (including any Future Transaction). {{brand_acronym}} does not undertake any obligation or responsibility for notifying a User if they do or may have insufficient funds available or if their permitted Direct Pay payment method is or is not funded, to participate (including any Future Transactions) prior to rejecting the relevant transaction (provided that the foregoing will not restrict {{brand_acronym}}’s ability to so notify a User).</p>
                  <p>In addition, subject to certain exceptions, any monetary Prizes or Bonuses that are to be awarded through {{brand_domain}}, including those funded through Direct Pay for a Standard User Account, will be loaded to the Standard User Account by means of a credit to the notional balance of such User Account.  The withdrawal of funds representing such Prizes/Bonuses from a User Account will be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  Instructions for claiming any non-monetary Prizes will be provided to Users by {{brand_acronym}} from time to time.</p>
                  <h4>6.2 - Depositing Funds and Using Direct Pay</h4>
                  <p>A User may have the option to, using fiat currency only:</p>
                  <ol class="lower-roman">
                    <li>fund their Standard User Account by depositing funds with {{brand_acronym}}; or</li>
                    <li>complete a purchase using Direct Pay, by means of an accepted Payment Method.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>No other Payment Methods, other than those accpeted by {{brand_acronym}} are permitted.</p>
                  <p>{{brand_acronym}} reserves the right to change, add, or remove accepted Payment Methods, and the terms and conditions applicable to accepted Payment Methods, subject to notice, if applicable. Users are solely responsible for reviewing accepted Payment Methods before initiating any transaction with {{brand_acronym}}.</p>
                  <p>Users should be aware that some credit card issuers may treat the funding of a User Account as a cash advance and charge a fee for each such credit card transaction. Any cash advance fee or other fees relating to the use of a Payment Method are the User’s sole responsibility.</p>
                  <p>Credit cards or debit cards that are accepted Payment Methods must be issued by a financial institution that permits purchases of cryptocurrencies. Users may only deposit funds using a Payment Method for which the User is an authorized user, as defined by their financial institution, or payment processing operator, as applicable.</p>
                  <p>{{brand_acronym}} will not collect online banking or password information.</p>
                  <p>A User should familiarize themselves with the terms and conditions that govern the use of their chosen Payment Method prior to using it to fund a User Account or for Direct Pay including, but not limited to any cash advance fees or other fees related to the use of the Payment Method. </p>
                  <p>{{brand_acronym}} or its payment processing service providers may store Payment Method or card information on servers located outside of the User's region. In addition, {{brand_acronym}} and its payment processing service providers may use and disclose aggregated transaction information for various analytical purposes relating to their respective businesses (but not relating to a specific or identifiable User). By using an accepted Payment Method to fund a User Account or for Direct Pay, the User expressly consents to {{brand_acronym}} or its payment processing service providers, or both, storing such transaction information located on servers located outside of the User's region, but using and disclosing aggregated transaction information for the purposes described in this paragraph. </p>
                  <p>The merchant reference associated with any deposit transaction will be “LAST MAN HODLING”. </p>
                  <p>Each time a User uses an accepted Payment Method to make a deposit with {{brand_acronym}} for purposes of funding the notional balance of a Standard User Account and/or to make a purchase using Direct Pay, they will be deemed to represent and warrant to {{brand_acronym}} that the User has all necessary rights and authority to use such credit card, debit card or the funds in the relevant bank account for such purposes, including in circumstances in which the credit card, debit card or bank account is jointly held with one or more other persons or is held by a person other than the User.</p>
                  <p>{{brand_acronym}}, or its payment processing service providers, will hold a User's monies that are deposited with {{brand_acronym}} for purposes of funding the notional balance of a Standard User Account in a bank account or escrow account as trustee for the User (not as banker or debtor). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, {{brand_acronym}} will deal with a User's money that has been deposited with {{brand_acronym}} as a trustee, and nothing contained herein shall create or give rise to any obligation on the part of {{brand_acronym}} to repay any money to the User as the User's debtor. For the avoidance of doubt, a User Account is not a bank account and, therefore, is not insured, guaranteed, sponsored, or otherwise protected by any deposit or banking insurance system. Funds deposited with {{brand_acronym}} for purposes of funding the notional balance of a Standard User Account, and monetary Prizes/Bonuses that are credited to a User Account, will not accrue interest for the benefit of the User, and the User shall not be entitled to claim any interest from {{brand_acronym}} in respect of any such funds. </p>
                  <p>In the event that any amount becomes owing to {{brand_acronym}} by the User under or in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, {{brand_acronym}} shall have the right to deduct such amounts from the User's Unutilized Funds and to adjust the notional balance of funds in the Standard User Account accordingly without the requirement for any advance or further notice to be provided to the User by {{brand_acronym}}. </p>
                  <h4>6.3 - Deposit and Direct Pay Limits &amp; Limitations</h4>
                  <p>In addition to any deposit limits established by a User, {{brand_acronym}} (in its sole discretion) may restrict a User's ability to fund the notional balance of a Standard User Account or their ability to engage in Direct Pay, including but not limited to by:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>establishing minimum and maximum amounts of funds that may be deposited by a User with {{brand_acronym}} for the purpose of funding the notional balance of a Standard User Account, on a transaction-by-transaction basis or during one or more time periods;</li>
                    <li>limiting the number of different credit cards that a Standard User can use to fund a User Account or make a purchase using Direct Pay.  In addition, a particular credit card may not be registered with more than one User Account;</li>
                    <li>restricting a User's ability to change deposit methods during specified periods of time;</li>
                    <li>restricting a User's ability to change certain credit card information or otherwise impose conditions prior to changing credit card information (for example, requiring that the User contact User Support);</li>
                    <li>changing acceptable methods of payment; or</li>
                    <li>limiting the number of deposits that a User can make for the purpose of funding the notional balance of a User Account.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Subject to the deposit limits set by {{brand_acronym}} pursuant to this Section 6.3, a User has the option to set, change or remove deposit limits for their Standard User Account applicable to the periods of time and in the manner contemplated in the Rules.</p>
                  <h4>6.4 - Chargebacks</h4>
                  <p>A “<strong>Chargeback</strong>” occurs for the purposes of this Agreement when a credit or debit cardholder contacts the bank or other financial institution that issued the card to initiate a refund for a payment transaction that was made using the card or the account associated with the card, and the bank or financial institution requests that {{brand_acronym}} return the relevant funds.</p>
                  <p>If a User funds the notional balance of their Standard User Account or completes a purchase using Direct Pay and thereafter a Chargeback occurs in respect of all or part of the transaction, {{brand_acronym}} (or any of its third-party service providers) may take any or all of the following actions, in each case as {{brand_acronym}}, in its sole discretion, determines to be appropriate:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Suspend the User Account pending resolution of any dispute relating to the Chargeback in accordance with Section 12.1; </li>
                    <li>Request that the User contact User Support to explain the circumstances of the Chargeback;</li>
                    <li>debit the Unutilized Funds in the Standard User Account with the amount of the Chargeback.  If that debit results in a negative balance of Unutilized Funds in the User Account, the amount of the negative balance will constitute a debt owed by the User to {{brand_acronym}}, and {{brand_acronym}} reserves the right to recover such amount from the User;</li>
                    <li>Deactivate the User Account and exclude the User from participation on {{brand_domain}} (i.e., deem the individual to thereafter be an Excluded Individual); or</li>
                    <li>Initiate a dispute resolution process with the relevant bank or financial institution, which may include {{brand_acronym}} providing evidence relating to the deposit transaction and/or Chargeback to a payment processing service provider and/or a bank or financial institution.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h3>7 | Withdrawals from a User Account</h3>
                  <h4>7.1 - Methods of Withdrawing Unutilized Funds</h4>
                  <p>Subject to certain exceptions, withdrawals of Unutilized Funds from a Standard User Account may be processed by means of an electronic</p>
                  <ol class="lower-roman">
                    <li>bank transfer to a bank account that is registered by the User and which {{brand_acronym}} has verified and approved, to its satisfaction, is held by the User at a bank or other financial institution acceptable to {{brand_acronym}} in their region.  A User is not permitted to designate a bank account for such purposes that is not held by the User (alone or together with other persons). This withdrawal method is at the sole discretion of {{brand_acronym}}; or</li>
                    <li>cryptocurrency transfer to the User's on-chain wallet.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>The User acknowledges and agrees that:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>{{brand_acronym}} may require the User to submit documentation (by electronic upload via {{brand_domain}}, or initiate a transaction, or as {{brand_acronym}} may otherwise instruct) that, in {{brand_acronym}}'s sole determination, evidences the User's authority over the bank account or cryptocurrency wallet that is to be registered.  For example, {{brand_acronym}} may require a copy of a void cheque or a bank account statement, in either case which includes the User's name, civic address and the bank account number, all of which must match the information associated with the User Account that is stored in {{brand_acronym}}'s application;</li>
                    <li>by submitting such documentation to {{brand_acronym}}, the User will be deemed to represent and warrant to {{brand_acronym}} that such documentation is a true, accurate and complete copy of the original; and</li>
                    <li>if the User registers a bank account that is held jointly with one or more other persons, withdrawals of Unutilized Funds from their Standard User Account will be paid into such joint account and, therefore, may be accessed by the other account holders.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>A User will not be entitled to specify any other payment method or currency of payment for a withdrawal.  For example, a User will not be able to withdraw Unutilized Funds to a credit card even if the User used a credit card to deposit funds with {{brand_acronym}} for purposes of funding the notional balance of their Standard User Account.  {{brand_acronym}}, in its sole discretion, may from time to time return Unutilized Funds to a User by other appropriate means.</p>
                  <h4>7.2 - Withdrawal Limits &amp; Limitations</h4>
                  <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, a User may withdraw Unutilized Funds from their Standard User Account up to the then-current balance of Unutilized Funds.</p>
                  <p>A User will not be entitled to withdraw Unutilized Funds from a Standard User Account through {{brand_domain}} at any time that a User Account is Suspended unless {{brand_acronym}}, in its sole discretion, determines that the withdrawal (in whole or in part) will be permitted.  If a Standard User Account is Suspended and the User wants to make a withdrawal of Unutilized Funds, the User must contact User Support.</p>
                  <p>{{brand_acronym}} may from time to time specify minimum and maximum withdrawal amounts applicable to User Accounts.  If a User wishes to withdraw less than a specified minimum amount, or more than a specified maximum amount, the User must contact User Support.</p>
                  <p>{{brand_acronym}} may from time to time limit the number of withdrawals of Unutilized Funds by a User that a User can make during a specified period of time.</p>
                  <h4>7.3 - Withdrawal Cancellations</h4>
                  <p>{{brand_acronym}} may, in its discretion, refuse a withdrawal request if {{brand_acronym}} suspects such withdrawal is made in breach of this Agreement (whether or not such violation is a Material Breach). {{brand_acronym}} will make reasonable efforts to promptly notify the User of such refusal via the User Contact Information associated with the Standard User Account.</p>
                  <p>A User may be permitted to cancel their withdrawal request through their Standard User Account, at the sole discretion of {{brand_acronym}}. Provided such cancellation has not been processed by {{brand_acronym}}, the relevant funds will be returned to the Unutilized Funds in the Standard User Account. </p>
                  <h4>7.4 - Withdrawal Processing Times</h4>
                  <p>Following a User's request to withdraw Unutilized Funds from their Standard User Account and the satisfaction of all other terms and conditions for a withdrawal (including providing any required information or documentation to {{brand_acronym}}), in most circumstances {{brand_acronym}} will be able to process the withdrawal within five to ten Business Days.  In some circumstances, a longer period of time for processing a withdrawal may be required.  {{brand_acronym}} will not be required to notify the User of any delay associated with the processing of a withdrawal of Unutilized Funds or the reason for such delay unless additional information or documentation is required to be provided by the User.</p>
                  <h4>7.5 - Prize Redemption</h4>

                  <h3>8 | Bonus Funds Terms</h3>
                  <h4>8.1 - Bonus Funds</h4>
                  <p>From time to time, {{brand_acronym}} may, in its sole discretion, whether for promotional purposes or otherwise, offer to upload Bonus Funds into a User Account or User's on-chain wallet, subject to the User (in their discretion) accepting the offer of the Bonus Funds.  Bonus Funds have a notional monetary value only, so they are not Unutilized Funds at the time they are awarded.  A User is not entitled to receive Bonus Funds unless {{brand_acronym}}, in its sole discretion, determines that Bonus Funds should be offered to a particular User.  A User will not be obligated to accept Bonus Funds. A User can forfeit Bonus Funds at any time by contacting User Support.</p>
                  <p>{{brand_acronym}} will have the right to determine the qualification criteria for all promotions and awarding of Bonus Funds.  The criteria may be specified in the terms and conditions that {{brand_acronym}} determines are applicable to any specific Bonus Funds, and any use of such Bonus Funds must comply with the applicable terms and conditions relating thereto (the “<strong>Bonus Funds Terms</strong>”).  All Bonus Funds Terms will be deemed to be incorporated by reference in this Agreement, and Section 3 herein shall govern to the extent of any inconsistency between the Bonus Funds Terms and the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
                  <p>The awarding and availability of Bonus Funds are in {{brand_acronym}}'s sole discretion.  The use of Bonus Funds may be limited to specific features and specific periods of time, and Bonus Funds may expire and be cancelled if they are not used prior to a specified date or time.  The applicable Bonus Funds Terms should be consulted.  In addition, {{brand_acronym}} may cancel Bonus Funds that have been uploaded into a User Account at any time in its sole discretion.</p>
                  <h4>8.2 - Using Bonus Funds</h4>
                  <p>If a User who wants to participate in various features, having either/both Bonus Funds and Unutilized Funds in their User Account (regardless of whether the awarding of the Bonus Funds preceded or followed the credit of notional funds to the balance of the User Account, whether resulting from a deposit of funds with {{brand_acronym}} by the User or the winning of a Prize by the User), the Unutilized Funds will be used first to participate until all of the Unutilized Funds have been utilized, following which time the Bonus Funds will be used.</p>
                  <p>The Bonus Funds Terms may contemplate that certain Bonus Funds will become Unutilized Funds only after certain wagering requirements have been satisfied.  A User should review the applicable Bonus Funds Terms prior to accepting an offer of Bonus Funds.  If a User does not accept the applicable Bonus Funds Terms in their entirety, then the User must not accept the relevant Bonus Funds or opt-out of the promotion in accordance with such Bonus Fund Terms.</p>
                  <h3>9 | Advertising</h3>
                  <h4>9.1 - Publishing Winner Information</h4>
                  <p>{{brand_acronym}} may publish the winner’s name/username/handle, Prize amount, account status, transaction date(s), and paid date on {{brand_acronym}}’s web site ({{brand_domain}}) and social media. </p>
                  <h3>10 | Dormant Accounts</h3>
                  <h4>10.1 - How a User Account Becomes a Dormant Account</h4>
                  <p>A User Account will become a Dormant Account if there has not been a User-Initiated Transaction for an extended period of time, or the project cycle ends without a claim from the User. For this purpose, a <strong>“User-Initiated Transaction”</strong> means</p>
                  <ol class="lower-roman">
                    <li>a deposit of funds by the User for the purpose of funding the Standard User Account,</li>
                    <li>a withdrawal of Unutilized Funds from the User Account, or</li>
                    <li>a purchase, including a Future Transaction that has not expired or been suspended due to insufficiency of Unutilized Funds or for any other reason.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>For the avoidance of doubt, participation is not considered a User-Initiated Transaction.  If a Future Transaction associated with such a User Account expires or is suspended or cancelled for any reason, the foregoing inaction period will be calculated beginning on the day that the last Future Transaction is processed from the User Account, being the last User-Initiated Transaction.</p>
                  <h4>10.2 - Effects of a Dormant Account</h4>
                  <p>A User is not restricted from accessing their User Account during the time it is a Dormant Account. A Dormant Account (that has not been Deactivated) will cease to be a Dormant Account upon the completion of a User-Initiated Transaction. If a User Account remains a Dormant Account for an extended period of time, {{brand_acronym}} will Deactivate such User Account no earlier than the seven (7) days after the date the User Account became a Dormant Account. </p>
                  <p>Upon a User Account becoming a Dormant Account, {{brand_acronym}} will use reasonable efforts to notify the User via the email address associated with such User Account of the following:</p>
                  <ol class="lower-roman">
                    <li>the User’s User Account has become a Dormant Account;</li>
                    <li>if applicable, the balance of Unutilized Funds associated with the Standard User Account;</li>
                    <li>the consequences of the User not taking the steps contemplated in this Section 10.2 to remove the Dormant Account status from their User Account.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Notwithstanding Section 12.2, upon the Deactivation of a Dormant Account, {{brand_acronym}} will automatically retain the Unutilized Funds subsisting at such time until:</p>
                  <ol class="lower-roman">
                    <li>{{brand_acronym}} approves a request from the Intending User to reactivate their Deactivated Dormant Account in accordance with Section 10.3; or</li>
                    <li>{{brand_acronym}} receives proper instructions relating to the disposition of such funds from the User or their legal representative.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h4>10.3 - Reactivation of a Deactivated Dormant Account</h4>
                  <p>{{brand_acronym}} will retain information relating to a Deactivated Dormant Account in the application in accordance with its record retention policies. If a Dormant Account is Deactivated pursuant to Section 10.2, the Intending User associated with such Dormant Account may thereafter contact User Support to request the reactivation of such Dormant Account. If such a Deactivated Dormant Account is reactivated, it will have the same account details as those which existed as of the date the Dormant Account was Deactivated. In the event that any of the relevant information has changed (for example, the User Contact Information), the Intending User will be solely responsible for updating such information and complying with the terms and conditions of this Agreement which are then in effect.</p>
                  <h3>11 | User Closure of Accounts</h3>
                  <h4>11.1 - Closure of a User Account by the User</h4>
                  <p>A User may close their User Account at any time by contacting User Support (“<strong>Closed Account</strong>”).  If a User is no longer eligible to have a User Account (for example, if the User will be relocating to a jurisdiction outside where participation is not permitted, or if the User becomes an Excluded Individual), the User is required to Close their User Account.</p>
                  <p>Upon Closure of a User Account, the User Account will no longer be accessible by the User. Renewed access to and use of a User Account for an Intending User with a Closed Account is subject to {{brand_acronym}} approval in its sole and absolute discretion and may be requested by the Intending User only by contacting User Support. All Future Transactions associated with the Closed User Account that have not been completed by the time of Closure will be cancelled. </p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding the Closure of the account, {{brand_acronym}} will retain a User’s information in accordance with its record retention policies. For more information on how {{brand_acronym}} retains a User’s personal information, see the {{brand_acronym}} Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy</p>
                  <p>Subject to the minimum withdrawal requirements in Section 7.2 and documentation requirements in Section 4.3, if a User Closes their User Account and Unutilized Funds remain in the User Account at that time, {{brand_acronym}} will return the Unutilized Funds to the User's bank account or cryptocurrency wallet that is associated with the User Account, if possible, via the details of which are stored by {{brand_acronym}}.  In the event that no bank account or cryptocurrency wallet is associated with the User Account, or if {{brand_acronym}} is not able to successfully deposit the Unutilized Funds in such bank account (for example, because the bank account has been closed or because {{brand_acronym}} requires additional information in order to confirm that the bank account belongs to the User), {{brand_acronym}} will use reasonable efforts to contact the User using the User Contact Information to advise as to the status of the User Account and the balance of Unutilized Funds.</p>
                  <h3>12 | Deactivation/Suspension of a User Account</h3>
                  <h4>12.1 - Suspension of a User Account</h4>
                  <p>{{brand_acronym}} shall have the right to suspend a User Account at any time in its sole discretion (a “<strong>Suspended Account</strong>”). Without limiting the foregoing, and by way of example only, {{brand_acronym}} may Suspend a User’s access to their User Account if it suspects that the User has improperly initiated a Chargeback or has committed any breach of this User Agreement, applicable law, or the Rules. </p>
                  <p>While a User Account is Suspended: </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>a User will be unable to login or access their User Account; </li>
                    <li> a User will be unable to withdraw any Unutilized Funds from a Standard User Account or redeem any Prizes from a User Account, unless {{brand_acronym}}, in its sole discretion, determines otherwise; </li>
                    <li>all Future Transactions associated with the Suspended User Account will be suspended and/or cancelled (i.e. no purchase or other financial transaction in respect thereof that has not been completed at the time the User Account is Suspended will be completed); and</li>
                    <li>a User may be required to cooperate with any investigations conducted by {{brand_acronym}} into the User’s conduct prior to the Suspension being lifted (including provisions of additional documentation or information as requested by {{brand_acronym}}). Failure to cooperate with this subsection 12.1(d) shall be deemed a Material Breach of this Agreement. </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>If, during the Suspension, {{brand_acronym}} determines that the User has committed a Material Breach of this Agreement, it may Deactivate the User Account in accordance with Section 12.2. Renewed access to and use of a User Account for an Intending User with a Suspended Account is subject to {{brand_acronym}} approval in its sole and absolute discretion and may be requested by the Intending User only by contacting User Support.</p>
                  <h4>12.2 - Deactivation of User Accounts</h4>
                  <p>{{brand_acronym}} shall have the right to deactivate a User Account at any time in its sole discretion (a “<strong>Deactivated Account</strong>”).</p>
                  <p>If {{brand_acronym}} Deactivates a User Account, {{brand_acronym}} will deposit an amount equal to the Unutilized Funds as at such date into the bank account or cryptocurrency wallet that is associated with the User Account (subject to the minimum withdrawal requirements detailed in Section 7.2 and additional documentation requirements in Section 4.3), the details of which are stored by {{brand_acronym}} on the iGaming System.  In the event that no method is associated with the User Account, or if {{brand_acronym}} is not able to successfully deposit the Unutilized Funds in such method (for example, because the bank account has been closed or because {{brand_acronym}} requires additional information in order to confirm that the bank account belongs to the User), {{brand_acronym}} will use its reasonable efforts to contact the User using the User Contact Information.  If {{brand_acronym}} is unable to contact the User, then {{brand_acronym}} will retain the Unutilized Funds or Prizes associated with the User Account, as applicable, until {{brand_acronym}} receives proper instructions relating to the disposition of such funds from the User or their legal representative. Any costs associated with the return of these funds will be deducted from the funds, in so much that if the associated costs exceed the funds, no funds will be returned.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, if {{brand_acronym}} Deactivates a User Account as a result of the occurrence of a Material Breach by the User under this Agreement, {{brand_acronym}} (in its sole discretion) shall be entitled to treat any or all of the Unutilized Funds or Prizes associated with the User Account as forfeited by the User, in which case the User will not be entitled to have such funds provided. Renewed access to and use of a User Account for an Intending User with a Deactivated Account is subject to {{brand_acronym}} approval in its sole and absolute discretion and may be requested by the Intending User only by contacting User Support.</p>
                  <h3>13 | Effect of Deactivation/Closure of User Accounts</h3>
                  <p>Without limiting the foregoing, when a User Account is a Closed Account or a Deactivated Account:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Any scheduled transactions (including for Future Transactions) that have not been completed prior to the Closure or Deactivation will be cancelled;</li>
                    <li>the User will not be entitled to receive any new Bonus Funds or Rewards, and any existing Bonus Funds associated with the User Account will be cancelled and the User will not be entitled to receive any compensation in respect of the cancelled Bonus Funds; and</li>
                    <li>this Agreement will terminate, except for those provisions which by their nature are intended to survive the termination of this Agreement.</li>

                  <h4>14.5 - Collusion, Cheating, Fraud and Criminal Activity</h4>
                  <p>Each User is prohibited from engaging in, and is required to immediately notify {{brand_acronym}} upon becoming aware that another User is or may be engaging in, any form of collusion, cheating, fraud or criminal activity or otherwise exploiting an unfair advantage involving any usage or participation by any User of {{brand_domain}}, including in connection with the registration of a User Account, the deposit of funds with {{brand_acronym}} to the credit of the notional balance of a User Account, making a purchase, or the withdrawal of Unutilized Funds.</p>
                  <p>For the purposes of this Agreement, the following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of collusion, cheating, fraud, criminal activity and/or the exploitation of an unfair advantage:</p>

                    <li>criminal activity includes money laundering;</li>
                    <li>an unfair advantage includes use of any software that could provide a User with an unfair advantage (including, by way of example only, “bots”, artificial intelligence, machine learning software, malicious code, profiling software, automatic trading software, viruses, worms, or malware);</li>

                  <h4>15.1 - {{brand_acronym}}'s Errors</h4>
                  <p>A number of circumstances may arise where usage or purchase is accepted by {{brand_acronym}} in error, where {{brand_acronym}} awards a Prize, credits a User Account or processes a withdrawal in error, or where a Rule includes an error (each an <strong>“Error”</strong>).

However, it may not be possible to notify Users in advance of Downtime, including in circumstances beyond {{brand_acronym}}'s control (for example, a power failure) or if the Downtime is determined to be necessary to address a potential or actual security threat or breach.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, a User shall not be entitled to any compensation arising from or as a result of any Downtime including, for example, if a User is unable to withdraw Unutilized Funds through {{brand_domain}} or if Bonus Funds expire during the period of any Downtime.</p>

                  <h3>Does {{brand_acronym}} Disclose Personal Information?</h3>
                  <p>From time to time, {{brand_acronym}} may disclose personal information to service providers or vendors acting on its behalf to enable them to perform specific types of processing and other specialized services.</p>
                  <p>For example, {{brand_acronym}} may partner with third parties to offer Users a prize, and those third parties may require personal information in order to deliver that prize to the rightful winners. Service providers and vendors may collect, use, and disclose personal information on {{brand_acronym}}’s behalf as described in this policy. Service providers and vendors who process personal information on behalf of {{brand_acronym}} are contractually obliged to protect the privacy of {{brand_acronym}} Users and to only process personal information for the specific purpose(s) for which {{brand_acronym}} provides instruction or permission.</p>
                  <p>Additionally, {{brand_acronym}} may disclose personal information to law enforcement, regulators, and other third parties where permitted or required by law.</p>
                  <h3>How is Personal Information Retained and Secured?</h3>
                  <p>Personal information collected by {{brand_acronym}} is retained in accordance with applicable law and {{brand_acronym}}’s records retention policies.

Access to personal information at {{brand_acronym}} is restricted to individuals who require such access to perform their duties. Furthermore, {{brand_acronym}} imposes information security requirements on third party vendors and service providers to whom personal information is disclosed. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. {{brand_acronym}} therefore does not warrant, represent, or guarantee the absolute security personal information in our custody or under our control.</p>

                  <p>In general, and in addition to other processing as described throughout this Policy, the processing of personal information for administering Internet Gaming accounts can be organized into four main phases:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li class="m-b-10"><strong>Registration &amp; Account Activation</strong> – when you choose to register for an account, {{brand_acronym}} will collect certain identity, demographic, contact information, and device information. This information will be used to administer your account throughout your use of our website and application, to confirm your eligibility for registration, and for anti-fraud and legal compliance purposes. Additionally, {{brand_acronym}} will seek to confirm what region you are located in, as {{brand_acronym}}’s service is only available to persons residing in, and who use the service while physically located in, jurisdictions where such a service is legal.<br><br>
                    Prior to account activation, {{brand_acronym}} will seek to verify the protocol-level identity of a registering individual. To confirm your identity, {{brand_acronym}} shares some of the information you provide at registration with a third party identity verification service(s). If your identity cannot be verified with the information you provided at registration, you will not be able to complete the registration. The information will be retained in a manner consistent with this Policy and {{brand_acronym}}’s internal retention and information security procedures.</li>
                    <li class="m-b-10"><strong>Use of the Service</strong> - after registration and account activation, you will be able to securely log into {{brand_acronym}}’s website and application. When you log in, {{brand_acronym}} will seek to confirm that the device you are using is located in a lawful jurisdiction, as {{brand_acronym}}’s service is only available to persons residing in, and who use the service while physically located in, jurisdictions where such use would be legal. Additionally, information about your use, such as transaction data, and usage history will be retained and used to provide you access to your overall account history, for responsible purposes including monitoring, analyzing and communicating with you about your use of the website and application, and for purposes as otherwise described throughout this Policy.</li>
                    <li class="m-b-10"><strong>Purchasing &amp; Withdrawals</strong> – while logged in to the website and application, you will have the option to purchase certain {{brand_acronym}} products and services. Should you choose to do so, {{brand_acronym}} will collect payment information and payment through its third party secure payment providers. Transaction information will be processed to provide you access to a history of your transactions, for anti-fraud purposes, for compliance with applicable law and regulation, and as otherwise described throughout this Policy.<br><br>
                    Should you choose to withdraw funds from your {{brand_acronym}} account, {{brand_acronym}} will collect account information from you to process your withdrawal requests. This information will be shared with {{brand_acronym}}’s partner financial institution to process your withdrawal request. Where permitted or required for compliance with applicable law, {{brand_acronym}} may collect additional information from a third party identity verification service.<br><br>
                    In addition, you may be required to upload supporting documentation to confirm your withdrawal information. Access to uploaded supporting documentation will only be provided to {{brand_acronym}} personnel who require such access to complete the withdrawal process. The documentation will be retained in a manner consistent with this Policy and {{brand_acronym}}’s internal retention and information security procedures.</li>
                    <li class="m-b-10"><strong>Inactivity &amp; Deletion</strong> –in certain circumstances as described in the User Agreement, your account may be deemed inactive or dormant. In such circumstances, personal information will be retained in accordance with applicable law and {{brand_acronym}}’s records retention policies. After the applicable retention period for records containing personal information has elapsed, the records are securely disposed of in accordance with {{brand_acronym}} information security policies.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>In addition to the processing as described above, your personal information associated with your account may be processed in circumstances unique to you. Examples of such processing include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="m-b-10"><strong>Customer Service</strong> – additional personal information may be collected and processed to assist you with your customer service inquiries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prize Winner Publication</strong> – should you win a qualifying prize, your personal information may be published as described in the User Agreement and where permitted or required by law.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>To provide our products, offerings and services, your personal information may be disclosed to third party service providers assisting {{brand_acronym}} in the provision and administration of the application. Examples of such third parties include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="m-b-10"><strong>Identity Verification Services</strong> – to prevent fraudulent activity and for compliance with applicable law, {{brand_acronym}} shares your DLT protocol address with a third party service at registration or in the course of administering active accounts;</li>
                    <li class="m-b-10"><strong>Content Providers</strong> – to provide for participation, {{brand_acronym}} shares your preferences, Username, and a unique alphanumeric identifier assigned by {{brand_acronym}} to your application account with third party content providers; and</li>

Your full payment information is retained by the secure payment provider, and is not shared with or stored by {{brand_acronym}}.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Any personal information collected, used or disclosed in the course of providing and administering the application may be stored by {{brand_acronym}} or its third party service providers outside {{brand_acronym}}'s jurisdiction, and is retained in accordance with its records retention policies.</p>
